**Objective** : To predict the amount of natural gas consumption.

**Dataset** : The dataset is the collected gas consumption (not uploaded here, we need to replace it with our own dataset).

**What I do** : Try to compare the performance of ARIMA, LSTM, SARIMA, GRA_LSTM, SARIMA_LSTM series model and SARIMA_LSTM parallel model on this dataset.
